# Largest-Transcribed-Rectangles


## Overview
This script provides a solution for the Largest Transcribed Rectangle problem which is a well-known computational geometry challenge, focusing on identifying the largest rectangle that can be inscribed within each polygon in a given shapefile. This problem is of significant interest across various fields, including geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning, and spatial analysis, due to its implications for optimizing land use and enhancing spatial decision-making processes.

This python solution employs an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the problem.

## Features
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Employs an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the computational geometry problem.
- **Dynamic Solution Space Exploration**: Utilizes mutation, crossover, and selection to explore possible solutions, adapting and evolving to find the largest inscribed rectangles.
- **Shapefile Processing and Output**: Accepts input shapefiles with multiple polygons and generates a new shapefile with the optimal rectangles.
- **Wide Application**: Ideal for spatial analysis, urban planning, GIS tasks, and any field requiring optimization within spatial constraints.
